# No Pause
Basic mod that lets the game run while paused, disables pausing when out of focus, and automatically transitions levels.
Optional reference included.

# Disclaimer
I'm really bad at Spelunky so I've barely tested this, but I made it through 2-1 without any issues so I assume it's fine.

# Installation
Copy "no_pause" or "no_pause_this_is_the_run" to your 'Spelunky 2'/Mods/Packs folder. I would advise against attempting to run both simultaneously.
